## üèóÔ∏è **Technical Implementation Strategy**

### **Shared Component Architecture**

```typescript
// Reusable dashboard components
const DashboardComponents = {
  // Layout components
  SidebarProvider,
  MetricsGrid,
  DataTable,
  ChartContainer,

  // Form components
  ProgressiveForm,
  FilterPanel,
  BulkActions,

  // UI components
  GlassCard,
  MetricCard,
  ActionMenu,
};
```

### **State Management Strategy**

```typescript
// Unified state management
const DashboardStore = {
  // Admin state
  admin: {
    metrics: null,
    users: [],
    events: [],
    systemHealth: null,
  },

  // Organizer state
  organizer: {
    events: [],
    attendees: [],
    analytics: null,
    revenue: null,
  },

  // Attendee state
  attendee: {
    events: [],
    tickets: [],
    recommendations: [],
    profile: null,
  },
};
```

### **API Architecture**

```typescript
// Unified API structure
const DashboardAPI = {
  // Real-time subscriptions
  subscriptions: {
    metrics: "/api/dashboard/metrics",
    attendees: "/api/dashboard/attendees",
    events: "/api/dashboard/events",
  },

  // CRUD operations
  admin: {
    users: "/api/admin/users",
    events: "/api/admin/events",
    finance: "/api/admin/finance",
  },

  // Business operations
  organizer: {
    events: "/api/organizer/events",
    attendees: "/api/organizer/attendees",
    analytics: "/api/organizer/analytics",
  },

  // User operations
  attendee: {
    events: "/api/attendee/events",
    tickets: "/api/attendee/tickets",
    recommendations: "/api/attendee/recommendations",
  },
};
```

```typescript
// Design system components
const DesignSystem = {
  // Colors
  colors: {
    primary: "hsl(var(--primary))",
    secondary: "hsl(var(--secondary))",
    success: "hsl(var(--success))",
    warning: "hsl(var(--warning))",
    error: "hsl(var(--error))",
  },

  // Spacing
  spacing: {
    xs: "0.25rem",
    sm: "0.5rem",
    md: "1rem",
    lg: "1.5rem",
    xl: "2rem",
  },

  // Typography
  typography: {
    heading: "font-semibold text-2xl",
    subheading: "font-medium text-xl",
    body: "text-base",
    caption: "text-sm text-muted-foreground",
