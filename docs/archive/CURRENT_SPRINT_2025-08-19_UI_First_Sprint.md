# 🚀 Sprint: UI‑First Landing, Event Pages, Checkout (Aug 19–25, 2025)

## 🎯 Goal

Ship a UI‑heavy refresh: public landing, event pages, and a clean RSVP/checkout UX (guest first, mobile‑first), plus repo cleanup.

## ✅ Definition of Done

- New landing hero with primary CTA, social proof, fast LCP
- Event discovery and detail pages with prominent “Get tickets/RSVP” CTA
- Registration flow: guest, minimal fields, progress indicator, trust signals, mobile‑optimized
- Basic a11y (focus, contrast) and performance pass

1. **Step 1:** Create Event Button & Form ✅
2. **Step 2:** Event List Display with Attendee Count ✅
3. **Step 3:** Event Details Page with Navigation ✅
4. **Step 4:** Event Editing (Mobile Responsive) ✅
5. **Step 5:** Event Deletion (Already Implemented) ✅
6. **Step 6:** Attendee Registration Form with Validation & Animation ✅

## 🗂 Scope

- Marketing landing page (hero, value prop, social proof, CTA)
- Event discovery list (cards, basic filters)
- Event detail (above‑the‑fold key facts + CTA; about/FAQ/share)
- RSVP/checkout (guest default, summary, progress, trust cues)
- Cleanup: archive/merge `sprint-planning/` if redundant

## 🔬 QA

- Mobile: sticky primary action, thumb zone CTAs, single column
- Guest checkout works end‑to‑end; inline validation and specific errors
- Home/event pages LCP ≤ 2s; no jarring CLS
- Keyboard accessible; visible focus rings

- ✅ Email system already works
- ✅ Database schema exists
- ✅ UI components ready (shadcn/ui)
- ✅ Authentication in progress
- ✅ Create form already exists and looks great!
- 🎯 Foundation for everything else

## 📦 Git Plan

- feat(ui): landing hero + sections
- feat(events): discovery list + filters
- feat(events): detail page + CTA
- feat(checkout): guest RSVP with progress + trust
- chore(a11y/perf): focus/contrast/LCP tweaks
- chore(cleanup): archive `sprint-planning/`
