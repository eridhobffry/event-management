## 📊 **SUCCESS TRACKING**

### **Daily Standup Questions**

1. What payment features did I complete yesterday?
2. What's blocking my Stripe integration today?
3. Are we on track for Thursday's first ticket sale?

### **Sprint Demo Goals (Thursday Evening)**

- ✅ Create test event with paid tickets
- ✅ Complete full purchase flow on mobile
- ✅ Receive confirmation email with QR code
- ✅ View sales dashboard with revenue metrics

### **Definition of Done for MVP Payment System**

- [ ] Stripe test payments working end-to-end
- [ ] QR code tickets generated and emailed
- [ ] Public ticket purchase pages live
- [ ] Sales dashboard shows revenue + tickets sold
- [ ] Mobile purchase flow tested and working
- [ ] Basic error handling and edge cases covered

## 💡 **RISK MITIGATION**

### **Potential Blockers & Solutions**

1. **Stripe Complexity** → Start with simplest flow, add features incrementally
2. **QR Code Issues** → Use proven libraries, test early and often
3. **Email Delivery** → Leverage existing Brevo integration
4. **Time Pressure** → Focus on core flow first, polish features second

### **Backup Plans**

- If Stripe is too complex: Start with "Request to Pay" system
- If QR codes fail: Use simple ticket numbers initially
- If time is short: Manual payment confirmation as interim solution

---

## 🚀 **MOTIVATION & VISION**

> **This sprint transforms us from "event registration tool" to "revenue-generating platform"**

By Thursday evening, we'll have:

- ✅ A working payment system competing with Zentrale.events
- ✅ Digital tickets that look professional
- ✅ Revenue tracking for event owners
- ✅ Foundation for all advanced commerce features

**Monday's first task:** Get that Stripe test payment working! 🎯💳

**Ready to build the future of event management!** 🚀✨
